# CampAIgn

## Introduction
CampAIgn is at the forefront of integrating advanced AI and NLP technologies into creative domains, particularly focusing on developing an intelligent chatbot to generate compelling video game stories in French. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and Vector Databases, we aim to revolutionize the storytelling process in game development.

## Motivation
Our primary goal is to leverage sophisticated AI tools to enhance creativity in video game development. By deploying advanced French language models, we aim to produce nuanced and engaging narratives tailored to French-speaking audiences, bridging the gap between technological innovation and creative storytelling.

## Project Scope
This project involves:
- Developing a chatbot to generate video game stories in French.
- Fine-tuning language models on a specialized corpus.
- Implementing a robust backend using FastAPI or Flask.
- Creating a user-friendly Single Page Application (SPA).
- Integrating DevOps practices for continuous integration and deployment.

## Key Objectives
1. **Smart Chatbot Development:** Utilize RAG, LangChain, and Vector Databases for story generation.
2. **Language Model Fine-tuning:** Customize French language models for high-quality narrative output.
3. **Robust Backend Implementation:** Ensure efficient and scalable backend architecture.
4. **User-Friendly SPA Creation:** Design an intuitive interface for seamless interaction.
5. **DevOps Integration:** Maintain performance and reliability through continuous integration and deployment.
